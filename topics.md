# List of potential topics to cover

The following is a list of brainstorming about which concepts, technologies and solutions should be covered in this project. It's a matter of discussion and I as the initiator of this repo have not enough knowledge about some of the items in this list. We need to start with something, so I did this list. You're more than welcome to open an issue and add content to any part of this document. Even comments are welcome. Thank you! ðŸ’š
